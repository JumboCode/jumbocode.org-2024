With this system, it should be easier for designers to check items that are in or out of stock at the Theatre. This includes uploading pictures, assigning locations within the theatre, and recording the condition (pristine, needs repair, etc.). With this comprehensive system, designers can quickly check availability, locate specific items, and ensure everything they need for a production is readily at hand.",
